## Operating Systems

### Mobile Operating Systems
The stock version of Android installed on most phones (i.e., Google Pixel stock Android, Samsung One UI, Xiaomi MIUI, Oppo ColorOS) include loads of privacy-invasive apps and trackers by default, many of which you are unable to remove without special methods, such as rooting the Android device. However, there are many alternatives to the pre-installed operating system on your phone that can enhance your privacy and security.
